# Notes App

Note taking app built using MERN Stack

## Description

This is a project created by our team using MERN stack which is a simple note taking app which uses react js for structuring and functionality and Node js and MongoDB. Developers use these two pieces of technology, along with MongoDB Atlas, a fully managed, multi-cloud database service, to rapidly create modern applications.
Here users can save their important notes and delete the old or unused ones.
It's a fun project to develop your skills in MERN stack to implement real world application which makes day to day task a little less hasty.
